# binance-plugin

A simple plugin that adds some functionality I would like to see in Binance's trading window.

## Installation Instructions

Copy all files into any folder of your choosing.

In Firefox, open a new tab and enter this URL:

`about:debugging`

Click on "This Firefox", then "Load Temporary Add-on...", then select the `manifest.json` file.

Refresh your open Binance trading window, if it's already open.
